# SecPol2025 Repository
Business Continuity Project - Security Policy

This Repository is a group project for the Business Continuity Class (CSIA 260) at Ivy Tech Community College's Cyber Academy. It is not intended as representation or estimation of the real Security Policy in place by the Honda plant in Greensburg. Instead, this project is the creation of a general security policy built from the ground up for an automotive plant operating in Indiana. We chose to create a security policy in the way that a real company might,  instead of a creating fictional one. This decision was made in order to have clearer guidelines and expectations regarding subjects such as laws & regulations, third party policies, and core business functions. The security policy is only one of many potential parts in the process of securing an organization, but it is the point where security begins. There are 11 members in contribution to this project, each responsible for their respective chapters. This project represents a combined effort spanning the length of 8 weeks over the summer of 2025.


# How to Start
1. Go to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) and make an account.
2. Download the LaTeX Source from this repository (the release or the .zip file), and upload it to overleaf. Begin Writing your assigned section(s).
3. The files outside of the "chapters" folder are so that you can compile your edited version correctly, please don't change them as this can lead to compilation issues on my end when all the chapter documents have been submitted.
4. When completed, please submit the finished & formatted chapter (only the chapter) into the "Completed Chapters Here" directory.

*Tip*: If you want to see what the formatting currently looks like, download the files from the latest release.

# Getting started with LaTeX
There are many youtube guides to help you learn the basics of LaTeX and overleaf.

1. Quick Start: [Learn Overleaf in 6 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcTN4F3l9Ds)

2. More Syntax: [Learn LaTeX Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfRmmZ_84Mw)

3. The [Overleaf Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) is a great place to learn more and troubleshoot any issues.


# Proper Formatting
1. Don't add chapters to your assigned chapter, instead use sections only (we decided to do no subsections in class).
2. Usage of tables, graphs, etc. is encouraged!
3. Prior to your chapter being submitted, please append the list of terms you would like me to include in the glossary as a seperate .txt file (send to me privately). It is important that each entry has a unique key, so make sure to examine the current source before adding a term or acronym.
4. All Chapters must include \section 's for Purpose & Scope at minimum, with \section's for each different policy topic.

*Tip*: Please use the following format for your glossary entries
```
\newglossaryentry{integrity}{
    name={ Integrity },
    description={ Ensures that data is accurate and has not been tampered with. }
}
```
# Common Mistakes
1. If you are ever confused on how to format or set up your chapter, please examine my AUP/GRC policies to examine the proper document preamble/formatting options. This will ensure that your document is able to be compiled correctly.
2. Avoid adding packages, \begin{document}, \end{document}, or anything of the sort that affects the entirety of the document.
3. If you have images, or require the addition of packages, inform me via a dm, the official group chat, or school discord channels.
