# SecPol2025 Repository
Business Continuity Project - Security Policy

# How to Start
1. Go to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) and make an account.
2. Download the LaTeX Source from this repository (the .zip file), and upload it to overleaf. Begin Writing your assigned section(s).
3. The files outside of the "chapters" folder are so that you can compile your edited version correctly, please don't change them as this can lead to compilation issues on my end when all the chapter documents have been submitted.
4. When completed, please submit the finished & formatted chapter (only the chapter) into the "Completed Chapters Here" directory.

*Tip*: If you want to see what the formatting currently looks like, download the latest .pdf file from the ~/SecPol2025 directory.

# Getting started with LaTeX
There are many youtube guides to help you learn the basics of LaTeX and overleaf.

2. More Syntax: [Learn LaTeX Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfRmmZ_84Mw)

3. The [Overleaf Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) is a great place to learn more and troubleshoot any issues.


# Proper Formatting
1. Don't add chapters to your assigned chapter, instead use sections/subsections.
2. Usage of sections or subsections is encouraged!
3. Prior to your chapter being submitted, please append the list of terms you would like me to include in the glossary at the end of your chapter's document. It is important that each entry has a unique key, so make sure to examine the current source before adding a term or acronym.

*Tip*: Please use the following format for your glossary entries
```
\newglossaryentry{integrity}{
    name={ Integrity },
    description={ Ensures that data is accurate and has not been tampered with. }
}
```
