\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this policy is to define the proper use of email and Internet services for Honda. These guidelines are designed to protect sensitive company information, reduce the risk of cyber security threats, and maintain compliance with both corporate and legal standards. All users of HMINâ€™s digital communication systems must adhere to the rules described in this policy.

\section{Scope}

This policy applies to all individuals with access to Honda's email or internet systems, including full-time associates, part-time workers, contractors, interns, and third-party service providers. All users are to follow these rules regardless of job role or location within the facility.

    \item \textbf{}Email systems at Honda are provided exclusively for business-related communication. Personal use of email accounts is prohibited. Users must not send or forward confidential or proprietary information without proper authorization, and any sensitive data transmitted via email must be encrypted.

    \item \textbf{}It is critical to remain cautious of phishing emails; users should not click on suspicious links or open unknown attachments, and any questionable messages must be reported to the IT Helpdesk immediately.

    \item \textbf{}Automatic forwarding of emails to non-Honda email accounts is strictly forbidden unless explicitly approved by IT Security.

    \item \textbf{}Social media use is restricted to official business communications and requires prior approval from the Communications or HR departments.

All use of email and web services is subject to monitoring by the Honda IT Security team. Activities will be logged to ensure compliance with this policy and to investigate any suspected violations.
